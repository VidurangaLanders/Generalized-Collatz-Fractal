# Generalized-Collatz-Fractal
 This code is an adapted version of a collatz fractal visualization to visualize a more generalized function

 The 3x+1 problem (Collatz Conjecture) inspired this research initiative. After playing around with the conjecture for a while, my first instinct was to generalize it and substitute the "3" and "1" in the "3x+1" equation with variables. While a single error is not always good, two errors may be advantageous at times. That's how I came across a generalization to the years old Collatz Conjecture. Later, I discovered that Prof. M. Bruschi had proposed a similar generalized form in 2008, with a challenge to disprove his idea. While his approach was completely theoretical, mine was based on time sequence graphs, which are often used to visualize the Collatz Conjecture. The intriguing result is that, while this approach provides another way to obtain Prof. M. Bruschi's conjecture, when applied to his generalized equation, it produces various patterns that are difficult to define with my limited expertise.
